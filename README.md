# This is Todo-Todo! 
# Vue 3 + Vite

This is the final Project of the Ironhack Bootcamp 2022. It is a simple an plain todo list, nothing else, nothing more.

## Technologies:

Well, it was built on Vue, with no dedicated framework. All the styles are carved "a pelo". It takes time to put it all togheter but I hopes It will do the trick. I Â´ve decided to use Firebase and not supabase, because I was familiarized with Google products. Nothing special.
Beside this, theres no much to say.

## Thanks to Marc, Pablo and Christian for the patience and dedicated company.
